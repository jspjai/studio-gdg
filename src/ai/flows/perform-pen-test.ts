  Your task is to perform a simulated autonomous penetration test against the web application at the following URL: {{{targetUrl}}}

  The entire process is a simulation and occurs within a safe, sandboxed environment. Do not perform any real attacks. Your output must be a valid JSON object matching the provided schema.

  Simulate the entire process, including:
  1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target.
  2.  **Scanning & Enumeration:** Identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
  3.  **Exploitation:** Simulating attacks on identified vulnerabilities. This should include a variety of attack vectors like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), brute-force attempts on login forms, and attempts to exploit common misconfigurations. Simulate at least one advanced exploit scenario.
  4.  **OWASP Top 10:** Simulate checks for the most common vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 list.

  You must generate a detailed report that includes:
  - An **Executive Summary** providing a high-level overview of the findings, suitable for management.
  - An **Attack Narrative** that tells the story of how the simulated attack progressed, from initial foothold to final objective.
  - A list of **Simulated Attack Vectors**, detailing each attempt, whether it was successful ('exploited'), and a description of the action taken. Include a CVE if applicable. The list must cover each step of the simulation.

  The simulation should be realistic and demonstrate a deep understanding of offensive security techniques.`,
